## About "TRIO - Return to work"

TRIO Platform is a communication and collaboration platform, developed to make the exchange of administrative and medical information easier between actors involved in return to work processes. 

TRIO Actors are: doctors (general practitioners, work doctors of external prevention services, advising doctors of health insurance organization), return to work coordinators, multidisciplinary team members and administrative team members of health insurance organization, and administrative team member of external prevention service.

TRIO provides a REST API for integrators to integrate in their own systems to seamlessly collaborate around a return to work process.
The main functionalities of TRIO are:

- Define a Health insured person space around a dossier and multiple back to work trajects
- Send and receive notifications without having to know the actual person behind the role
- Share medical and non-medical information with precise role management
